Golang

Introduction
============

Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is used for all kinds of tasks, including web development. Noteworthy features include memory safety, garbage collection, and a strong concurrency model.

Programs written in Go are distributed as big binaries statically including all dependencies most of the time. So the tools provided by us are only needed to modify or write go programs yourself, but not to run them.

Versions
========

We only provide the latest version of Go. This may change, once go 2.0 is released.

Check out the `⚛️ Uberlab <https://lab.uberspace.de/tags/lang-go>`_ for guides!

As noted above, most of the guides will download ready-made binaries instead of actually building from source.
